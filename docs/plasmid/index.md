Plasmid is a library and mod that forms the core of Nucleoid, providing a base to build minigames on top of.

!!! quote "From the plasmid README"
    Plasmid intends to do all the boring work related to minigame implementation, to rather allow focused effort on just the game itself.

!!! warning
    Current plasmid documentation is not up-to-date with the latest releases, including plasmid 0.5 for Minecraft 1.17.

!!! note
    The current documentation is imported from [the old GitHub wiki](https://github.com/NucleoidMC/plasmid/wiki), and was originally written by Gegy.
