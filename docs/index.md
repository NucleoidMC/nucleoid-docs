# Welcome!

Here you can find documentation about Nucleoid's libraries and other tools. Have a look in the navigation bar to find what you are looking for.

If you want to get started making a minigame, you probably want to look at [Plasmid](plasmid/index.md). If you want to contribute translations, [see our Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/nucleoid/). You can also come and chat with us [on Discord](https://nucleoid.xyz/discord) in the `#minigame-dev` channel!
